# Training-PokemonAPI-project

The purpose of this project is to train my skills in working with HTTP requests
to the backend, and working with REST API and AJAX.
When you enter the name or id of a pokemon in the search term and then submit, 
a Pok√©API request is made and a card with the image and main characteristics 
of the pokemon is rendered.
