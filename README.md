# Training-PokemonAPI-project

The purpose of this project is to train my skills in working with HTTP requests
to the backend, and working with REST API and AJAX.


When you enter a Pokemon's name or ID(1 to 1008) into a search term and then submit,
a Pok√©API request is made and a card with an image and basic characteristics
pokemon is displayed.
